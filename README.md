# gde-v
RISC-V core for Godot 4.x

## Usage
To be added! For now, there is some info in the test project directory on how to use it.

## Documentation
Documentation is incoming! Once it's generated it will be on Read The Docs. For now, we've tried to add plentiful comments to help with understanding. There are also a couple (uncommented) scenes in a test project that run RISC-V programs.

## Builds
For now, there is a compiled build for all targets the default GDExtension template targets, but only Windows debug x64 single-precision has been tested. It is located under the Actions, and is provided as a ZIP that can be extracted into a project and used.

## Licenses
gde-v is licensed under the MIT license (see LICENSE). For dependencies, see each sub folder in "external".
