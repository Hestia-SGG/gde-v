## Usage
To be added! For now, there is some info in the test project directory on how to use it.

You can also refer to the in-Godot documentation for all of the classes.

## Documentation
Documentation is incoming! Currently it's all in Godot, but I'm having issues extracting it from there. Once it's extracting it will be on Read The Docs. For now, we've tried to add plentiful comments to help with understanding. There are also a couple (uncommented) scenes in a test project that run RISC-V programs.

## Builds
For now, there is a compiled build for all targets the default GDExtension template targets, but only Windows debug x64 single-precision has been tested. It is located under the Actions, and is provided as a ZIP that can be extracted into a project and used.

## Licenses
gde-v is licensed under the MIT license (see LICENSE). For dependencies, see each sub folder in "external".
